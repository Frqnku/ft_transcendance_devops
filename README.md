## Overview

This repository focuses on the **DevOps** part of the *ft_transcendance* school project, delivering a secure, scalable, and robust infrastructure to support microservices.

---

## üöÄ My DevOps Contribution

I am responsible for designing and implementing the following solutions:

### üîê Authentication Service  
- Secure authentication based on **JWT**  
- Integration of **2FA** (Two-Factor Authentication) for enhanced access security  

### üê≥ Dockerization of Microservices  
- Full **containerization of microservices** to ensure portability and isolation  
- Optimized Docker images with multi-staging and light distro for production use  

### üåê Nginx with Reverse Proxy & WAF  
- Setup of a performant **Nginx reverse proxy** for request routing  
- Integration of **ModSecurity** as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks  

### üîê SSL Certificate Management  
- Secure storage of SSL certificates using **HashiCorp Vault**  
- Automated certificate renewal and deployment  

### üìä Advanced Monitoring  
- Comprehensive infrastructure monitoring with **Prometheus**  
- Custom dashboards visualization via **Grafana**  

### üìù Centralized Logging  
- Log collection and processing with the **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
- Simplified troubleshooting and security auditing
